1. A Cup of Tea

Nan-in, a Japanese master during the Meiji era (1868-1912), 
received a university professor who came to inquire about Zen.

Nan-in served tea. He poured his visitor's cup full, 
and then kept on pouring.

The professor watched the overflow until he no longer could 
restrain himself. "It is overfull. No more will go in!"

"Like this cup," Nan-in said, "you are full of your
 own opinions and speculations. How can I show you Zen 
unless you first empty your cup?"
