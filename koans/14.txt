   40.   In Dreamland

   "Our schoolmaster used to take a nap every afternoon," related a
   disciple of Soyen Shaku. "We children asked him why he did it and he
   told us: 'I go to dreamland to meet the old sages just as Confucius
   did.' When Confucius slept, he would dream of ancient sages and later
   tell his followers about them.

   "It was extremely hot one day so some of us took a nap. Our
   schoolmaster scolded us. 'We went to dreamland to meet the ancient
   sages the same as Confucius did,' we explained. 'What was the message
   from those sages?' our schoolmaster demanded. One of us replied: 'We
   went to dreamland and met the sages and asked them if our schoolmaster
   came there every afternoon, but they said they had never seen any such
   fellow.'"
