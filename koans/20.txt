   58.   Arresting the Stone Buddha

   A merchant bearing fifty rolls of cotton goods on his shoulders stopped
   to rest from the heat of the day beneath a shelter where a large stone
   Buddha was standing. There he fell asleep, and when he awoke his goods
   had disappeared. He immediately reported the matter to the police.

   A judge named O-oka opened court to investigate. "That stone Buddha
   must have stolen the goods," concluded the judge. "He is supposed to
   care for the welfare of the people, but he has failed to perform his
   holy duty. Arrest him."

   The police arrested the stone Buddha and carried it into the court. A
   noisy croud followed the statue, curious to learn what kind of a
   sentence the judge was about to impose.

   When O-oka appeared on the bench he rebuked the boisterous audience.
   "What right have you people to appear before the court laughing and
   joking in this manner? You are in contempt of court and subject to a
   fine and imprisonment."

   The people hastened to apologize. "I shall have to impose a fine on
   you," said the judge, "but I will remit it provided each one of you
   brings one roll of cotton goods to the court within three days. Anyone
   failing to do this will be arrested."

   One of the rolls of cloth which the people brought was quickly
   recognized by the merchant as his own, and thus the thief was easily
   discovered. The merchant recovered his goods, and the cotton rolls were
   returned to the people.
