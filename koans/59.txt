   74.   True Reformation

   Ryokan devoted his life to the study of Zen. One day he heard that his
   nephew, despite the admonitions of relatives, was spending his money on
   a courtesan. Inasmuch as the nephew had taken Ryokan's place in
   managing the family estate and the property was in danger of being
   dissipated, the relatives asked Ryokan to do something about it.

   Ryokan had to travel a long way to visit his nephew, whom he had not
   seen for many years. The nephew seemed pleased to meet his uncle again
   and invited him to remain overnight.

   All night Ryokan sat in meditation. As he was departing in the morning
   he said to the young man: "I must be getting old, my hand shakes so.
   Will you help me tie the string of my straw sandal?"

   The nephew helped him willingly. "Thank you," finished Ryokan, "you
   see, a man becomes older and feebler day by day. Take good care of
   yourself." Then Ryokan left, never mentioning a word about the
   courtesan or the complaints of the relatives. But, from that morning
   on, the dissipations of the nephew ended.
