   8.   Great Waves

   In the early days of the Meiji era there lived a well-known wrestler
   called O-nami, Great Waves.

   O-nami was immensely strong and knew the art of wrestling. In his
   private bouts he defeated even his teacher, but in public he was so
   bashful that his own pupils threw him.

   O-nami felt he should go to a Zen master for help. Hakuju, a wandering
   teacher, was stopping in a little temple nearby, so O-nami went to see
   him and told him of his trouble.

   "Great Waves is your name," the teacher advised, "so stay in this
   temple tonight. Imagine that you are those billows. You are no longer a
   wrestler who is afraid. You are those huge waves sweeping everything
   before them, swallowing all in their path. Do this and you will be the
   greatest wrestler in the land."

   The teacher retired. O-nami sat in meditation trying to imagine himself
   as waves. He thought of many different things. Then gradually he turned
   more and more to the feeling of the waves. As the night advanced the
   waves became larger and larger. They swept away the flowers in their
   vases. Even the Buddha in the shrine was inundated. Before dawn the
   temple was nothing but the ebb and flow of an immense sea.

   In the morning the teacher found O-nami meditating, a faint smile on
   his face. He patted the wrestler's shoulder. "Now nothing can disturb
   you," he said. "You are those waves. You will sweep everything before
   you."

   The same day O-nami entered the wrestling contests and won. After that,
   no one in Japan was able to defeat him.
