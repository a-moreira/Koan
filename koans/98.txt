   90.   The Last Rap

   Tangen had studied with Sengai since childhood. When he was twenty he
   wanted to leave his teacher and visit others for comparitive study, but
   Sengai would not permit this. Every time Tangen suggested it, Sengai
   would give him a rap on the head.

   Finally Tangen asked an elder brother to coax permission from Sengai.
   This the brother did and then reported to Tangen: "It is arranged. I
   have fixed it for you to start on your pilgrimage at once."

   Tangen went to Sengai to thank him for his permission. The master
   answered by giving him another rap.

   When Tangen related this to his elder brother the other said: "What is
   the matter? Sengai has no business giving premission and then changing
   his mind. I will tell him so." And off he went to see the teacher.

   "I did not cancel my permission," said Sengai. "I just wished to give
   him one last smack over the head, for when he returns he will be
   enlightened and I will not be able to reprimand him again."
