   5.   If You Love, Love Openly

   Twenty monks and one nun, who was named Eshun, were practicing
   meditation with a certain Zen master.

   Eshun was very pretty even though her head was shaved and her dress
   plain. Several monks secretly fell in love with her. One of them wrote
   her a love letter, insisting upon a private meeting.

   Eshun did not reply. The following day the master gave a lecture to the
   group, and when it was over, Eshun arose. Addressing the one who had
   written to her, she said: "If you really love me so much, come and
   embrace me now."
