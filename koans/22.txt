   64.   Kasan Sweat

   Kasan was asked to officiate at the funeral of a provincial lord.

   He had never met lords and nobles before so he was nervous. When the
   ceremony started, Kasan sweat.

   Afterwards, when he had returned, he gathered his pupils together.
   Kasan confessed that he was not yet qualified to be a teacher for he
   lacked the sameness of bearing in the world of fame that he possessed
   in the secluded temple. Then Kasan resigned and became the pupil of
   another master. Eight years later he returned to his former pupils,
   enlightened.
