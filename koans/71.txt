   9.   The Moon Cannot Be Stolen

   Ryokan, a Zen master, lived the simplest kind of life in a little hut
   at the foot of a mountain. One evening a thief visited the hut only to
   discover there was nothing to steal.

   Ryokan returned and caught him. "You have come a long way to visit me,"
   he told the prowler, "and you should not return empty-handed. Please
   take my clothes as a gift."

   The thief was bewildered. He took the clothes and slunk away.

   Ryoken sat naked, watching the moon. "Poor fellow," he mused, "I wish I
   could have given him this beautiful moon."
