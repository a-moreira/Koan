   54.   The Last Will & Testament

   Ikkyu, a famous Zen teacher of the Ashikaga era, was the son of the
   emperor. When he was very young, his mother left the palace and went to
   study Zen in a temple. In this way Prince Ikkyu also became a student.
   When his mother passed on, she left with him a letter. It read:

      To Ikkyu:
         I have finished my work in this life and am now returning into
   Eternity. I wish you to become a good student and to realize your
   Buddha-nature. You will know if I am in hell and whether I am always
   with you or not.
         If you become a man who realizes that the Buddha and his follower
   Bodhidharma are your own servants, you may leave off studying and work
   for humanity. The Buddha preached for forty-nine years and in all that
   time found it not necessary to speak one word. You ought to know why.
   But if you don't and yet wish to, avoid thinking fruitlessly.

                                        Your Mother,
                                        Not born, not dead.

                                              September first.

   P.S. The teaching of Buddha was mainly for the purpose of enlightening
   others. If you are dependent on any of its methods, you are naught but
   an ignorant insect. There are 80,000 books on Buddhism and if you
   should read all of them and still not see your own nature, you will not
   understand even this letter. This is my will and testament.
