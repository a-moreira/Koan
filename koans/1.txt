   1.   A Cup of Tea

   Nan-in, a Japanese master during the Meiji era (1868-1912), received a
   university professor who came to inquire about Zen.

   Nan-in served tea. He poured his visitor's cup full, and then kept on
   pouring.

   The professor watched the overflow until he no longer could restrain
   himself. "It is overfull. No more will go in!"

   "Like this cup," Nan-in said, "you are full of your own opinions and
   speculations. How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup?"
