   11.   The Story of Shunkai

   The exquisite Shunkai whose other name was Suzu was compelled to marry
   against her wishes when she was quite young. Later, after this marriage
   had ended, she attended the university, where she studied philosophy.

   To see Shunkai was to fall in love with her. Moreover, wherever she
   went, she herself fell in love with others. Love was with her at the
   university, and afterwards when philosophy did not satisfy her and she
   visited the temple to learn about Zen, the Zen students fell in love
   with her. Shunkai's whole life was saturated with love.

   At last in Kyoto she became a real student of Zen. Her brothers in the
   sub-temple of Kennin praised her sincerity. One of them proved to be a
   congenial spirit and assisted her in the mastery of Zen.

   The abbot of Kennin, Mokurai, Silent Thunder, was severe. He kept the
   precepts himself and expected the priests to do so. In modern Japan
   whatever zeal these priests have lost for Buddhism they seemed to have
   gained for having wives. Mokurai used to take a broom and chase the
   women away when he found them in any of his temples, but the more wives
   he swept out, the more seemed to come back.

   In this particular temple the wife of the head priest had become
   jealous of Shunkai's earnestness and beauty. Hearing the students
   praise her serious Zen made this wife squirm and itch. Finally she
   spread a rumor about that Shunkai and the young man who was her friend.
   As a consequence he was expelled and Shunkai was removed from the
   temple.

   "I may have made the mistake of love," thought Shunkai, "but the
   priest's wife shall not remain in the temple either if my friend is to
   be treated so unjustly."

   Shunkai the same night with a can of kerosene set fire to the
   five-hundred-year-old temple and burned it to the ground. In the
   morning she found herself in the hands of the police.

   A young lawyer became interested in her and endeavoured to make her
   sentance lighter. "Do not help me." she told him. "I might decide to do
   something else which will only imprison me again."

   At last a sentance of seven years was completed, and Shunkai was
   released from the prison, where the sixty-year-old warden also had
   become enamored of her.

   But now everyone looked upon her as a "jailbird". No one would
   associate with her. Even the Zen people, who are supposed to believe in
   enlightenment in this life and with this body, shunned her. Zen,
   Shunkai found, was one thing and the followers of Zen quite another.
   Her relatives would have nothing to do with her. She grew sick, poor,
   and weak.

   She met a Shinshu priest who taught her the name of the Buddha of Love,
   and in this Shunkai found some solace and peace of mind. She passed
   away when she was still exquisitely beautiful and hardly thirty years
   old.

   She wrote her own story in a futile endeavour to support herself and
   some of it she told to a women writer. So it reached the Japanese
   people. Those who rejected Shunkai, those who slandered and hated her,
   now read of her life with tears of remorse.
