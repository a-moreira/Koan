   62.   In the Hands of Destiny

   A great Japanese warrior named Nobunaga decided to attack the enemy
   although he had only one-tenth the number of men the opposition
   commanded. He knew that he would win, but his soldiers were in doubt.

   On the way he stopped at a Shinto shrine and told his men: "After I
   visit the shrine I will toss a coin. If heads comes, we will win; if
   tails, we will lose. Destiny holds us in her hand."

   Nobunaga entered the shrine and offered a silent prayer. He came forth
   and tossed a coin. Heads appeared. His soldiers were so eager to fight
   that they won their battle easily.

   "No one can change the hand of destiny," his attendant told him after
   the battle.

   "Indeed not," said Nobunaga, showing a coin which had been doubled,
   with heads facing either way.
