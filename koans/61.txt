   80.   The Real Miracle

   When Bankei was preaching at Ryumon temple, a Shinshu priest, who
   believed in salvation through the repitition of the name of the Buddha
   of Love, was jealous of his large audience and wanted to debate with
   him.

   Bankei was in the midst of a talk when the priest appeared, but the
   fellow made such a disturbance that bankei stopped his discourse and
   asked about the noise.

   "The founder of our sect," boasted the priest, "had such miraculous
   powers that he held a brush in his hand on one bank of the river, his
   attendant held up a paper on the other bank, and the teacher wrote the
   holy name of Amida through the air. Can you do such a wonderful thing?"

   Bankei replied lightly: "Perhaps your fox can perform that trick, but
   that is not the manner of Zen. My miracle is that when I feel hungry I
   eat, and when I feel thirsty I drink."
