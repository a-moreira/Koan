   88.   How To Write a Chinese Poem

   A well-known Japanese poet was asked how to compose a Chinese poem.

   "The usual Chinese poem is four lines," he explained. "The first line
   contains the initial phrase; the second line, the continuation of that
   phrase; the third line turns from this subject and begins a new one;
   and the fourth line brings the first three lines together. A popular
   Japanese song illustrates this:

          Two daughters of a silk merchant live in Kyoto.
          The elder is twenty, the younger, eighteen.
          A soldier may kill with his sword,
          But these girls slay men with their eyes."
