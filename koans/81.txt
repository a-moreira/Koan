   39.   Sleeping in the Daytime

   The master Soyen Shaku passed from this world when he was sixty-one
   years of age. Fulfilling his life's work, he left a great teaching, far
   richer than that of most Zen masters. His pupils used to sleep in the
   daytime during midsummer, and while he overlooked this he himself never
   wasted a minute.

   When he was but twelve years old he was already studying Tendai
   philosophical speculation. One summer day the air had been so sultry
   that little Soyen stretched his legs and went to sleep while his
   teacher was away.

   Three hours passed when, suddenly waking, he heard his master enter,
   but it was too late. There he lay, sprawled across the doorway.

   "I beg your pardon, I beg your pardon," his teacher whispered, stepping
   carefully over Soyen's body as if it were that of some distinguished
   guest. After this, Soyen never slept again in the afternoon.
