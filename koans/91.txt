   69.   Eating the Blame

   Circumstances arose one day which delayed preparation of the dinner of
   a Soto Zen master, Fugai, and his followers. In haste the cook went to
   the garden with his curved knife and cut off the tops of green
   veetables, chopped them together, and made soup, unaware that in his
   haste he had included a part of a snake in the vegetables.

   The followers of Fugai thought they had never tasted such great soup.
   But when the master himself found the snake's head in his bowl, he
   summoned the cook. "What is this?" he demanded, holding up the head of
   the snake.

   "Oh, thank you, master," replied the cook, taking the morsel and eating
   it quickly.
