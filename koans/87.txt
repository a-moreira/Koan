   57.   The Gates of Paradise

   A soldier named Nobushige came to Hakuin, and asked: "Is there really a
   paradise and a hell?"

   "Who are you?" inquired Hakuin.

   "I am a samurai," the warrior replied.

   "You, a soldier!" exclaimed Hakuin. "What kind of ruler would have you
   as his guard? Your face looks like that of a beggar."

   Nobushige became so angry that he began to draw his sword, but Hakuin
   continued: "So you have a sword! Your weapon is probably much too dull
   to cut off my head."

   As Nobushige drew his sword Hakuin remarked: "Here open the gates of
   hell!"

   At these words the samurai, perceiving the master's discipline,
   sheathed his sword and bowed.

   "Here open the gates of paradise," said Hakuin.
