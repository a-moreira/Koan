   71.   Learning To Be Silent

   entered Japan. Four of them who were intimate friends promised one
   another to observe seven days of silence.

   On the first day all were silent. Their meditation had begun
   auspiciously, but when night came and the oil lamps were growing dim
   one of the pupils could not help exclaiming to a servant: "Fix those
   lamps."

   The second pupil was surprised to hear th first one talk. "We are not
   supposed to say a word," he remarked.

   "You two are stupid. Why did you talk?" asked the third.

   "I am the only one who has not talked," concluded the fourth pupil. It
   This is especially true for any person who talks for a living, such as
   negative view towards silence, where members of Eastern cultures tend
   to embrace it.
