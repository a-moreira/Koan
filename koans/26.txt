   76.   The Stone Mind

   Hogen, a Chinese Zen teacher, lived alone in a small temple in the
   country. One day four traveling monks appeared and asked if they might
   make a fire in his yard to warm themselves.

   While they were building the fire, Hogen heard them arguing about
   subjectivity and objectivity. He joined them and said: "There is a big
   stone. Do you consider it to be inside or outside your mind?"

   One of the monks replied: "From the Buddhist viewpoint everything is an
   objectification of mind, so I would say that the stone is inside my
   mind."

   "Your head must feel very heavy," observed Hogen, "if you are carrying
   around a stone like that in your mind."
