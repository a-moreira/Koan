   43.   Zen in a Beggar's Life

   Tosui was a well-known Zen teacher of his time. He had lived in several
   temples and taught in various provinces.

   The last temple he visited accumulated so many adherents that Tosui
   told them he was going to quit the lecture business entirely. He
   advised them to disperse and to go wherever they desired. After that no
   one could find any trace of him.

   Three years later one of his disciples discovered him living with some
   beggars under a bridge in Kyoto. He at one implored Tosui to teach him.

   "If you can do as I do for even a couple of days, I might," Tosui
   replied.

   So the former disciple dressed as a beggar and spent a day with Tosui.
   The following day one of the beggars died. Tosui and his pupil carried
   the body off at midnight and buried it on a mountainside. After that
   they returned to their shelter under the bridge.

   Tosui slept soundly the remainder of the night, but the disciple could
   not sleep. When morning came Tosui said: "We do not have to beg food
   today. Our dead friend has left some over there." But the disciple was
   unable to eat a single bite of it.

   "I have said you could not do as I," concluded Tosui. "Get out of here
   and do not bother me again."
