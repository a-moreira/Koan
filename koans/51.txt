   50.   Ryonen's Clear Realization

   The Buddhist nun known as Ryonen was born in 1797. She was a
   granddaughter of the famous Japanese warrior Shingen. Her poetical
   genius and alluring beauty were such that at seventeen she was serving
   the empress as one of the ladies of the court. Even at such a youthful
   age fame awaited her.

   The beloved empress died suddenly and Ryonen's hopeful dreams vanished.
   She became acutely aware of the impermanency of life in this world. It
   was then that she desired to study Zen.

   Her relatives disagreed, however, and practically forced her into
   marriage. With a promise that she might become a nun after she had
   borne three children, Ryonen assented. Before she was twenty-five she
   had accomplished this condition. Then her husband and relatives could
   no longer dissuade her from her desire. She shaved her head, took the
   name of Ryonen, which means to realize clearly, and started on her
   pilgrimage.

   She came to the city of Edo and asked Tetsugyu to accept her as a
   disciple. At one glance the master rejected her because she was too
   beautiful.

   Ryonen then went to another master, Hakuo. Hakuo refused her for the
   same reason, saying that her beauty would only make trouble.

   Ryonen obtained a hot iron and placed it against her face. In a few
   moments her beauty had vanished forever.

   Hakuo then accepted her as a disciple.

   Commemorating this occasion, Ryonen wrote a poem on the back of a
   little mirror:

        In the service of my Empress I burned incense to
                    perfume my exquisite clothes
                Now as a homeless mendicant I burn my face to
                    enter a Zen temple.

   When Ryonen was about to pass from this world, she wrote another poem:

        Sixty-six times have these eyes beheld the changing
                    scene of autumn
                I have said enough about moonlight,
                Ask no more.
                Only listen to the voice of pines and cedars when no
                    wind stirs.
