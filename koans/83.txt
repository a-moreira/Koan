   45.   Right & Wrong

   When Bankei held his seclusion-weeks of meditation, pupils from many
   parts of Japan came to attend. During one of these gatherings a pupil
   was caught stealing. The matter was reported to Bankei with the request
   that the culprit be expelled. Bankei ignored the case.

   Later the pupil was caught in a similar act, and again bankei
   disregarded the matter. this angered the other pupils, who drew up a
   petition asking for the dismissal of the thief, stating that otherwise
   they woudl leave in a body.

   When bankei had read the petition he called everyone before him. "You
   are wise brothers," he told them. "You know what is right and what is
   not right. You may somewhere else to study if ou wish, but this poor
   brother does not even know right from wrong. Who will teach him if I do
   not? I am going to keep him here even if all the rest of you leave."

   A torrent of tears cleansed the face of the brother who had stolen. All
   desire to steal had vanished.
