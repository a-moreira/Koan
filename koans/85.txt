   51.   Sour Miso

   The cook monk Dairyo, at Bankei's monastery, decided that he would take
   good care of his old teacher's health and give him only fresh miso, a
   paste of soy beans mixed with wheat and yeast that often ferments.
   Bankei, noticing that he was being served better miso than his pupils,
   asked: "Who is the cook today?"

   Dairyo was sent before him. Bankei learned that according to his age
   and position he should eat only fresh miso. So he said to the cook:
   "Then you think I shouldn't eat at all." With this he entered his room
   and locked the door.

   Dairyo, sitting outside the door, asked his teacher's pardon. Bankei
   would not answer. For seven days Dairyo sat outside and Bankei within.

   Finally in desperation an adherent called loudly to Bankei: "You may be
   all right, old teacher, but this young disciple here has to eat. He
   cannot go without food forever!"

   At that Bankei opened the door. He was smiling. He told Dairyo: "I
   insist on eating the same food as the least of my followers. When you
   become the teacher I do not want you to forget this."
