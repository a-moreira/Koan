   2.   Finding a Diamond on a Muddy Road

   Gudo was the emperor's teacher of his time. Nevertheless, he used to
   travel alone as a wandering mendicant. Once when he was on his way to
   Edo, the cultural and political center of the shogunate, he approached
   a little village named Takenaka. It was evening and a heavy rain was
   falling. Gudo was thoroughly wet. His straw sandals were in pieces. At
   a farmhouse near the village he noticed four or five pairs of sandals
   in the window and decided to buy some dry ones.

   The woman who offered him the sandals, seeing how wet he was, invited
   him in to remain for the night in her home. Gudo accepted, thanking
   her. He entered and recited a sutra before the family shrine. He was
   then introduced to the women's mother, and to her children. Observing
   that the entire family was depressed, Gudo asked what was wrong.

   "My husband is a gambler and a drunkard," the housewife told him. "When
   he happens to win he drinks and becomes abusive. When he loses he
   borrows money from others. Sometimes when he becomes thoroughly drunk
   he does not come home at all. What can I do?"

   "I will help him," said Gudo. "Here is some money. Get me a gallon of
   fine wine and something good to eat. Then you may retire. I will
   meditate before the shrine."

   When the man of the house returned about midnight, quite drunk, he
   bellowed: "Hey, wife, I am home. Have you something for me to eat?"

   "I have something for you," said Gudo. "I happened to be caught in the
   rain and your wife kindly asked me to remain here for the night. In
   return I have bought some wine and fish, so you might as well have
   them."

   The man was delighted. He drank the wine at once and laid himself down
   on the floor. Gudo sat in meditation beside him.

   In the morning when the husband awoke he had forgotten about the
   previous night. "Who are you? Where do you come from?" he asked Gudo,
   who was still meditating.

   "I am Gudo of Kyoto and I am going on to Edo," replied the Zen master.

   The man was utterly ashamed. He apologized profusely to the teacher of
   his emperor.

   Gudo smiled. "Everything in this life is impermanent," he explained.
   "Life is very brief. If you keep on gambling and drinking, you will
   have no time left to accomplish anything else, and you will cause your
   family to suffer too."

   The perception of the husband awoke as if from a dream. "You are
   right," he declared. "How can I ever repay you for this wonderful
   teaching! Let me see you off and carry your things a little way."

   "If you wish," assented Gudo.

   The two started out. After they had gone three miles Gudo told him to
   return. "Just another five miles," he begged Gudo. They continued on.

   "You may return now," suggested Gudo.

   "After another ten miles," the man replied.

   "Return now," said Gudo, when the ten miles had been passed.

   "I am going to follow you all the rest of my life," declared the man.

   Modern Zen teachings in Japan spring from the lineage of a famous
   master who was the successor of Gudo. His name was Mu-nan, the man who
   never turned back.
