   95.   A Letter to a Dying Man

   Bassui wrote the following letter to one of his disciples who was about
   to die:

   "The essence of your mind is not born, so it will never die. It is not
   an existence, which is perishable. It is not an emptiness, which is a
   mere void. It has neither color nor form. It enjoys no pleasures and
   suffers no pains.

   "I know you are very ill. Like a good Zen student, you are facing that
   sickness squarely. You may not know exactly who is suffering, but
   question yourself: What is the essence of this mind? Think only of
   this. You will need no more. Covet nothing. Your end which is endless
   is as a snowflake dissolving in the pure air."

   those who are dying or suffering with illnesses. It can also be a very
   comfort all those involved.
