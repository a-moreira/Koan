   63.   Killing

   Gasan instructed his adherents one day: "Those who speak against
   killing and who desire to spare the lives of all conscious beings are
   right. It is good to protect even animals and insects. But what about
   those who kill time, what about those who are destroying
   wealth, and those who destroy political economy? We should not overlook
   them. Furthermore, what about the one who preaches without enlightenment?
   He is killing Buddhism."
