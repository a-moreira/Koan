   55.   The Tea-Master & the Assassin

   Taiko, a warrior who lived in Japan before the Tokugawa era, studied
   Cha-no-yu, tea etiquette, with Sen no Rikyu, a teacher of that
   aesthetical expression of calmness and contentment.

   Taiko's attendant warrior Kato interpreted his superior's enthusiasm
   for tea etiquette as negligence of state affairs, so he decided to kill
   Sen no Rikyu. He pretended to make a social call upon the tea-master
   and was invited to drink tea.

   The master, who was well skilled in his art, saw at a glance the
   warrior's intention, so he invited Kato to leave his sword outside
   represents peacefulness itself.

   You wouldn't expect a tea-master to offer to clean a sword, since that
   always be accepted graciously.

   Kato would not listen to this. "I am a warrior," he said. "I always
   have my sword with me. Cha-no-yu or no Cha-no-yu, I have my sword."

   "Very well. Bring your sword in and have some tea," consented Sen no
   Rikyu.

   The kettle was boiling on the charcoal fire. Suddenly Sen no Rikyu
   tipped it over. Hissing steam arose, filling the room with smoke and
   ashes. The startled warrior ran outside.

   The tea-master apologized. "It was my mistake. Come back in and have
   some tea. I have your sword here covered with ashes and will clean it
   and give it to you."

   In this predicament the warrior realized he could not very well kill
   the tea-master, so he gave up the idea.
