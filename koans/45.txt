   32.   Inch Time Foot Gem

   A lord asked Takuan, a Zen Teacher, to suggest how he might pass the
   time. He felt his days very long attending his office and sitting
   stiffly to receive the homage of others.

   Takuan wrote eight Chinese characters and gave them to the man:

                Not twice this day
                Inch time foot gem.

                This day will not come again.
                Each minute is worth a priceless gem.
