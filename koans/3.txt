   7.   Announcement

   Tanzan wrote sixty postal cards on the last day of his life, and asked
   an attendent to mail them. Then he passed away.

   The cards read:

          I am departing from this world.
          This is my last announcement.

                      Tanzan
                      July 27, 1892
