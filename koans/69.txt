   3.   Is That So?

   The Zen master Hakuin was praised by his neighbours as one living a
   pure life.

   A beautiful Japanese girl whose parents owned a food store lived near
   him. Suddenly, without any warning, her parents discovered she was with
   child.

   This made her parents angry. She would not confess who the man was, but
   after much harassment at last named Hakuin.

   In great anger the parent went to the master. "Is that so?" was all he
   would say.

   After the child was born it was brought to Hakuin. By this time he had
   lost his reputation, which did not trouble him, but he took very good
   care of the child. He obtained milk from his neighbours and everything
   else he needed.

   A year later the girl-mother could stand it no longer. She told her
   parents the truth - the real father of the child was a young man who
   worked in the fishmarket.

   The mother and father of the girl at once went to Hakuin to ask
   forgiveness, to apologize at length, and to get the child back.

   Hakuin was willing. In yielding the child, all he said was: "Is that
   so?"
